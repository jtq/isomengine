# isomengine

Experimental isometric game engine

## Introduction

Click on the board (green spaces) to move the player object around.  Click on objects to interact with them (currently only outputs console messages identifying the action and object).

## Motivation

Attempting to build a simple isometric game-engine using DOM elements (for simplicity, accessibility and usability) and CSS transforms (for hardware acceleration).
